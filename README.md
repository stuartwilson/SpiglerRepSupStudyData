# SpiglerRepSupStudyData

Dataset accompanying the submitted paper:

Repetition suppression for composite faces discriminates between holistic and parts-based representation in the fusiform and occipital face areas

Spilger G, Mohamed N, Wilkinson I, Wilson S 

The [anonymous] pre-processed data is maintained per participant in folders titled e.g., data/sub01

Run the script ```python analysis.py``` to populate the 'extracted' folder with .csv files containing the beta regressor values for each condition (combined over ppts), and to populate the 'figs' folder with the main figures reported in the paper.
